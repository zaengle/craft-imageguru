By hooking in to Craft&#39;s built-in image transforms, ImageGuru allows you to use the same syntax you&#39;re used to, but with the added performance and storage benefits of off-server image transforms.</p><h2 id="why" tabindex="-1">Why? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Craft&#39;s built-in image transforms are great, but they have a few drawbacks:</p><ol><li><p>They run on the web server, which can be slow and resource intensive</p></li><li><p>They require you to store the transformed images in your Asset Volume, which can be expensive in terms of storage costs, especially if you have a lot of transforms (think <code>srcset</code>)</p></li><li><p>While there are plenty of great image transform plugins already out there, they generally they either require you to change your template code to use them and/or they are paid plugins.</p></li><li><p>ImageGuru is FOSS and is designed to be easily adopted into existing projects with minimal changes to your templates.
